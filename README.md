It is required to design an airplane boarding system based on simple microcontroller system. 
The passenger has to scan the boarding pass or enter a 3 digit unique identifier on the gate keypad. The 
gate  checks the  correctness  of the  input  data  over  the  airport  network.  If the  passenger  is  to  board  of 
the flight in question, a greeting message is displayed and the gate is open. The flight is identified by the 
first  digit  in  the  entered  unique  identifier,  and  the  guest  identification  is  in  the  following  2  digits.  It  is 
assumed that the flight capacity is only 100 persons on board. The Flight is marked complete if and only 
if the pilot and first officer are on board and all passengers have boarded. The pilot and first officer of all 
flights are always identified as “00” and “01” respectively in the passengers’ list. All flights are operated 
with another 8 crew members. 
Safety  circuit  for  the  gate  is  obligatory  in  the  system  design.  It  is  always  recommended  to  check  the 
motor  temperature  and  alarm  in  case  of over  heat. Also,  it  is mandatory to  keep  the  gate  open  during 
the passenger crossing period, especially in case of infant strollers passing.
